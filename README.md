# clj-freqt

A Clojure implementation of the **FREQT** algoritm for [Frequent Subtree Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent_subtree_mining) published in the following paper:

[Asai, Tatsuya, et al. "Efficient substructure discovery from large semi-structured data." IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems 87.12 (2004): 2754-2763.](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611972726.10)

The implementation is based on this [C++ implementaion of FREQT](http://chasen.org/~taku/software/freqt/) but has been extended in the following ways:

* Every subtree gets assigned a cost.
* Every iteration of the algorithm picks the next subtree with the lowest cost from a priority queue.
* It is possible to customize how the resulting set of subtrees should be accumulated.
