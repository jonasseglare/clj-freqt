# clj-freqt

A Clojure library implementing the **FREQT** algoritm for [Frequent Subtree Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent_subtree_mining) published in the following paper:

[Asai, Tatsuya, et al. "Efficient substructure discovery from large semi-structured data." IEICE TRANSACTIONS on Information and Systems 87.12 (2004): 2754-2763.](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611972726.10)

In short, this library can be used to find the most repetitive subtrees in a forest, including subtrees whose leaves can be inner nodes in the trees of the input forest.

The implementation is based on this [C++ implementation of FREQT](http://chasen.org/~taku/software/freqt/) but has been extended in the following ways:

* Every subtree gets assigned a cost.
* Every iteration of the algorithm picks the next subtree with the lowest cost from a priority queue.
* It is possible to customize how the resulting set of subtrees should be accumulated.

## Motivation

This code can be useful when implementing tools that automatically refactor code in order to discover repetitive sub structures that can be factored out.

## Library coordinates

Include
```
io.github.jonasseglare/clj-freqt {:git/sha "931a6e44d2dfe2b84f3695ca048c6f331520e9d9"}
```
in your `deps.edn` in order to use clj-freqt as a library.

## Usage

The `clj-freqt.core/freqt` function runs the freqt algorithm to find frequent subtrees. The first argument is a forest of trees, where every tree is represented as an s-expression. The first element in the s-expression is the *label* of the node and can be any value. The remaining elements are its children.

It outputs a list of all subtrees that satisfy some criteria and the support of each subtree:

```clojure
(require '[clj-freqt.core :refer [freqt]])

(freqt
 '[(d (a (b (b) (d)) (c (d (b) (d)))) (a))
   (d (c (a (a (c)) (b) (b)) (d (b))) (c))]
 {:min-support 3, :support-mode :weighted})
;; => {:status :completed, :subtrees [{:support 6, :weighted-support 6, :subtree-size 1, :subtree [b]} {:support 6, :weighted-support 6, :subtree-size 1, :subtree [d]} {:support 4, :weighted-support 4, :subtree-size 1, :subtree [c]} {:support 4, :weighted-support 4, :subtree-size 1, :subtree [a]} {:support 3, :weighted-support 3, :subtree-size 2, :subtree [a [b]]}]}
```
Note that the algorithm expects as input *labeled ordered trees*: Every child of an s-expression must have a label and the order of the children matters.

The *support* of a subtree is the number of times it occurs. By normal support, we count the number of trees in the forest where the subtree occurs at least once. By weighted support, we count all occurrences in all trees.

The algorithm can be configured using the second argument, see `default-freqt-config` for the default configuration:

```clojure
(def default-freqt-config
  {;; Minimum support required to include the subtree in the result.
   :min-support 1

   ;; Whether or not to display some extra info while running the algorithm.
   :verbose false

   ;; Minimum subtree size to include it in the result.
   :min-node-size 1

   ;; Maximum subtree size to include it in the result.
   :max-node-size int-max

   ;; How support is counted. `:normal` means that we count the number
   ;; of trees in the forest where it occurs at least once. `:weighted`
   ;; means that we count all occurrences.
   :support-mode :normal

   ;; Stop the algoritm after this many seconds.
   :timeout-seconds 20.0

   ;; Stop the algoritm when the number of results is this number.
   :max-result-count nil

   ;; Cost associated with each subtree being explored. In every iteration,
   ;; the algorithm picks the tree with the lowest cost. Therefore, this cost
   ;; can be used to guide the exploration.
   :costfn default-freqt-cost

   ;; The report function is used to accumulate the result and has the
   ;; following arities:
   ;; * 0: Return an empty result data structure.
   ;; * 1: Called on the result before it is returned to finalize it.
   ;; * 2: Called on the arguments `context` and `subtree` with `subtree` being
   ;;      the subtree considered, to accumulate the result.
   :reportfn default-report})
```
